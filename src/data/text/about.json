    "paragraph1": "On Pacific Street we have a one a month or so concert series at our home in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, New York. It's inspired by the idea that something beautiful happens when we sit (or stand or mosh) together in a welcoming space and listen. That the air of the place can be charged with warmth and energy before, during, and after the performance, in a way that feels different and exciting. We've found this is especially likely to be the case when held in a home that is lived in and loved, and we are lucky enough to have just the type of place to share.",
    "paragraph2": "We are only able to pull this off because of the incredible, talented, and loving people around us. Those include audio engineers, videographers, show goers, music lover, and such a mind bogglingl set of wildly talented artists that our brains can barely comprehend it.",
    "paragraph3": "We try at each show to create a space where the performers, listeners, and organizers have the opportunity to feel a part of an extended, growing community. To make a night that is place of communion for that community. If that sounds like your kind of thing then we'd love to see you at a show soon or even help you throw a show at your place."
